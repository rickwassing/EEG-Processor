**MARK BAD CHANNELS & EPOCHS**

In this video we'll introduce the Visual Inspection application and show you how to mark bad epochs and bad channels.

.. note::

    You'll probably notice in the video below that the EEG Processor looks different. That is because this is an older video in which I explain the Visual Inspection application, which has not changed between versions 1.0.0 and 2.0.0. So although the EEG Processor looks different and the data is different, the content of the video still applies.
